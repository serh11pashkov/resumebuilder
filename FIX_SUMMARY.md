# Resume Builder Application - Fix Summary

## Fixed Issues

1. **User Role Assignment**

   - Updated `AuthController.java` to always assign ROLE_USER to new users
   - Created SQL script `fix_user_roles.sql` to ensure all existing users have proper roles

2. **API URL Formatting**

   - Fixed URL format issues in `resume.service.js`:
     - Added missing slashes between API_URL and IDs
     - Corrected endpoint for retrieving user resumes from `API_URL + "user/" + userId` to `API_URL + "/user/" + userId`
     - Fixed all other endpoints (get, update, delete, PDF) to use the correct URL format

3. **Documentation**

   - Updated README.md with information about fixes
   - Added detailed section to DATABASE_SETUP.md for running the role assignment script
   - Created DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md with common issues and solutions

4. **Cleanup**
   - Created cleanup script to remove unnecessary test files
   - Created verification script to test that all fixes are working

5. **View Button Functionality in Resume List**
   - Fixed the View button in ResumeList.js by adding permission checking before loading resumes
   - Updated all remaining `hasRole()` annotations to `hasAuthority()` in backend controllers
   - Added a new debug endpoint for checking permissions for specific resumes
   - Added better error handling and user feedback in the ResumeView component
   - Created a detailed test script (test-resume-view.js) to verify the fix works properly

## How to Verify the Fixes

1. Make sure both the backend and frontend are running:

   ```
   # Terminal 1 - Start backend
   cd back
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run

   # Terminal 2 - Start frontend
   cd front
   npm start
   ```

2. Run the database fix script (if not already done):

   ```
   psql -U postgres -d resumebuilder -f fix_user_roles.sql
   ```

3. Run the verification script to test all API endpoints:

   ```
   cd g
   node verify-fixes.js
   ```

4. Clean up unnecessary test files:
   ```
   .\cleanup_test_files.ps1
   ```

## Manual Verification

1. Open the application in a browser: http://localhost:3000
2. Register a new user
3. Verify you can log in and access the resume dashboard
4. Create a new resume and verify it saves correctly
5. View, edit, and delete the resume to confirm all operations work

## Test Files Cleanup

The following test files were created during development and debugging and can be safely removed:

- `front/test-role-assignment.js` - Used to test user role assignment
- `front/test-resume-creation-debug.js` - Debugging script for resume creation
- `front/test-create-resume.js` - Test script for resume creation
- `front/test-api.js` - General API test script
- `front/test-admin-login.js` - Test script for admin login
- `front/src/auth-test.js` - Authentication test script
- `front/basic-api-test.js` - Basic API tests
- `front/auth-api-test.js` - Authentication API tests
- `front/api-test.cjs` - CommonJS API test script
- `front/test-resume-view.js` - Test script for resume view functionality

To remove these files, run the provided PowerShell script:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File cleanup_test_files.ps1
```

Note: The `front/src/App.test.js` file was preserved as it's part of the standard React testing setup.
