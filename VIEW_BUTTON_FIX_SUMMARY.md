# View Button Functionality Fix Summary

## Problems Identified

1. The View button in the Resume List page wasn't working correctly due to role permission issues
2. Some controllers were using `hasRole('USER')` instead of `hasAuthority('ROLE_USER')` which caused permission denial
3. Missing endpoint to check permissions for a specific resume
4. Missing error handling in the ResumeView component

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Role Check Annotations in Backend Controllers

Changed all remaining `hasRole()` annotations to `hasAuthority()` to properly check user roles:

- `ResumeController.java` - Updated the PDF endpoint and test-auth endpoint
- `UserController.java` - Updated all user endpoints that were checking for USER role

### 2. Added Resume-Specific Permission Checking

- Added a new debug endpoint `/api/resumes/debug/check-resume-permissions/{id}` that checks if a user has permission to view a specific resume
- The endpoint checks for admin role, resume ownership, or if the resume is public

### 3. Enhanced Frontend Service Methods

- Added `checkResumePermissions(resumeId)` method to the ResumeService class
- Added `updateResume(id, resumeData)` to properly match the backend API

### 4. Improved ResumeView Component

- Updated the resume loading logic to first check permissions before attempting to load a resume
- Added better error handling and user feedback
- Added debug logging to help diagnose issues

## How the Fix Works

1. When a user clicks the View button in the Resume List, they are taken to `/resumes/:id`
2. The ResumeView component now first calls `checkResumePermissions` to verify the user has permission to view this resume
3. If permission is granted, the resume is loaded and displayed
4. If permission is denied, an error message is shown with an option to return to the resume list

## Additional Benefits

1. Improved security by ensuring proper permission checks
2. Better error handling and user experience
3. More informative debug logs for future troubleshooting
